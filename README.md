Originally made by Jurgen "Juhox" Hoffmann.
This repo has working stable preinstalled OpenHunt 
based on Eugene C. improved baseq3a gamecode and fast q3tools.
Plus 3 cosmetic patches included, fov fix, lens flare in ffa bugfix and redblood instead of brown.

If you want just to play grab the hunt folder and put same location with your q3 exe and from mods play it. It's already with compiled openhunt vm.
