#### BUGS n FIX

* change name of mod to OpenHunt Plus
* rename hunts pk3s to openhunt and sort them into one (LepusC)
* fix the bug in UI both skirmish and from multiplayer changing
ADVANCED OPTIONS simply not applying to game
probably same goes to game templates
* fix the bug with grapplinghook, while crouching it will brake.
Probably because shooting entry is too low from player,
also possible to change grapplinghook type by cvar.
* additional names at the end of credits



DONE fix angle of railgun shot so it will simply push player back straight
DONE remove TEAM ARENA and CINEMATICS options on main menu

#### FEATURES

* More agressive/fast reaction monsters, especially guard type
* look if possible to make monster-bots and bots separate so real bots can be added
* investigate more about mapping for gamemode "Escape from Hell" (EFH).
* include g_unlagged.c (probably not needed)



#### Addons were made

* autoexec.cfg - more accurate gameplay
* zzz-hunt_sfx.pk3 - fix lens gfx in ffa gamemode
* zzz-hunt_redblood.pk3 - red blood instead of brown


#### Additional info
Thoose two files made by the original author from his website are missed.
If first file is probably not necessary because of new improved q3tools by Eugene C.,
then second would be very useful, though searching didn't give any results nor webarchive.

I've made a test EFH map without the mentioned file though, needs more investigation to make it work fine and write mini-instuction.
